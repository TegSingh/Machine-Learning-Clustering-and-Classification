# Machine Learning Clustering and Classification

This repository contains code for the following common machine learning and data mining algorithms:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. KNN - K Nearest Neighbours
3. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
4. Mean Shift Clustering
5. DBSCAN Clustering
6. Back Propagating Artificial NN
7. Perceptron Neural Network
8. Kohonen Network - Competitive Learning
